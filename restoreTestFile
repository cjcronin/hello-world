Plan to create file on master branch, create restoreTestBranch, make changes, merge changes back to master, 
delete branch, look at GitHub desktop.

-----> for grins, make another change on master branch!

THEN... Restore branch




First on-branch changes

Second on-branch change

Third on-branch change
