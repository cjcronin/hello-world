function [Change, TotTimeF, TotTimeB]=changebf_4(A,threshold)
% Function for counting how many times the worm changes from Forward to
% Backward and from Backward to Forward and the duration of movement
%
% Vector A indicates direction of travel:
%    1 = Forward
%   -1 = Backward
%
% The 'threshold' value indicates the minimum number of frames of forward
% or backward movement that are to be considered real movement.  That is,
% we are set up to ignore short stuff like jitter.

% Initialising Variables:
Tc = diff(A);         % +2 or -2 indicates places where the worm changes direction
% Ta = A(1:end-1);    % vector A without its the last value
% Tb = A(2:end);      % vector A starting from the second value
% Tc = Tb-Ta;         % +2 or -2 indicates places where the worm changes direction -- same as diff
