%WORMPROCElly    Master worm processing script
% 
%   Script to automate running PREORIENT and MANPROC functions
%     - Prompts for directory containing "worm1", "worm2"... folders
%         (each containing a file named "points" and a series of
%         corresponding image files).
%     - Runs PREORIENT*
%     - Runs MANPROC*
%     - Saves x and y matrices in a Matlab file called "data" 
%     - Saves x-y data timestamps, if available, in "data"
%     - Saves list of current functions used for wormproc
%
%   Note: x and y matrices will be ~1400 rows long (for a 4 minute 
%   worm recording) by (typically) 13 columns wide.  Each column 
%   represents a point along the "spine" (or centerline) of the worm, 
%   column 1 at the head, column 13 at the tail, the rest distributed 
%   evenly along the worm.  Rows are essentially snapshots of the 
%   worm's position over time with row 1 as the worm's first position, 
%   row 2 its next position,...  Each successive row is ~1/5 second 
%   later than the previous.  (The calculation for actual time delay 
%   between successive rows is calculated  by METRICS* and is used to 
%   scale the data to determine the worm's   velocity and frequency.  
%
%   Note:  SCRIPT, not a function!!!
