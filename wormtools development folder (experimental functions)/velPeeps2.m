% VELPEEPS2:  Provides basic velocity statistics for subsets of worms in a folder
%
% Syntax:  [] = velPeeps2(inputDirectory, 'ListOf', 'folderName', 'prefixes')
%    where:
% 'inputDirectory' = single folder containing a collection of worm data
%           formatted such that the folders in 'inputDirectory' are named,
%           for example,   
%               'N2_2007_01_04'
%               'N2_2007_01_05'
%               'N2_2007_01_08'
%               'N2_2007_01_12'
%               'plc-3_2007_01_14'
%               'plc-3_2007_01_17'
%               'sy12_2007_01_06'
%               'sy12_2007_01_11'
%               'sy12_2007_01_13'
%               ...
%
%           Each of the folders within 'inputDirectory' shall in turn
%           contain a single folder named 'worm1' with a file called
%           'veldata.mat' therein. 
%
% 'ListOf','FolderName','Prefixes' = a comma-separated list of
%           apostrophe-enclosed folder name prefixes represented in
%           'inputDirectory'.  For example, from the list above these might
%           include:
%               'N2_', 'sy12', 'plc-3'
%           refering to folders with names starting with those prefixes,
%           respectively.
%
%
% Example:
%       velPeeps2(...
%           'D:\Cheryl\4hrlethtracks',...
%           'N2_', 'ALA-', 'plc-3_');
