%TRANSLATION2    Calculate velocity from xy coordinate data.
%   FORMAT: [vel, theta, mode, velc] = translation3Cheryl(x, y, mmpp, spf, fpt)
%      where 
%      - "x" and "y" are matrices of x and y coordinates.  (Rows are 
%         time, columns are data points along a worm's "spine" from
%         head to tail).
%      - "mmpp" is the ratio "millimeters per pixel" which is 
%         a function of microscope and camera optics.  For the
%         Sternberg Lab's worm tracking rig in Kerckhoff 221:

%                 50x               0.0020
%      - "spf" (seconds per frame) is the time in seconds between
%         successive frames
%      - "fpt" (literally "frames per timeblock") is the 
%         number of frames to group together for the velocity 
%         calculation.  That is, velocity is calculated by 
%         sampling worm position every N'th frame, where N = fpt.
%      - "vel" is a vector of instantaneous velocities every N'th
%         frame (where N = fpt).  The velocities are the mean 
%         of point velocities of the rear ~2/3 of the worm 
%         (points 5 to the tail end).  
%      - "theta" is the angle (in radians) of movement
%      - "mode" is a flag indicating forward (1) or backward (-1)
%         movement.
%      - "velc" is a vector of instantaneous velocities of the CENTROID of
%         the rear 2/3 of the worm (mean position of points 5 to tail end).

%   Revised 
%   $Revision: 3.01 $  $Date: 2004/07/14 xx:xx:xx $
% 
% r3.01: Adds 'velc' calculation: speed of the CENTROID (mean position) 
%   of points [5:end].  Adds 'velc' to function output and help section.
%   Clarified help text to recognize that 'vel' is the mean of point 
%   5:end point velocities.
% 
% r2.03: Changes variable 'dir' to 'theta' to differentiate from
%   built-in function 'dir'.  Corrects angle (theta) calculation 
%   to reflect direction of travel instead of angle from (0,0) point.  
%   Dated 11-13-02 4:35 PM.
%
% r2.02: Adds help information.  Fills in revision history.
%   Dated 9-03-02 5:22 PM.
%
% r2.01: Calculates velocity by sampling change in position 
%   every N'th frame (where N = fpt).  Dated 6-07-02 5:27PM.
